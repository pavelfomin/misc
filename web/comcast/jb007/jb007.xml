      In From Russia With Love, the bad guys don't want to take over the world. They want something more mundane -- a Russian decoding device. Assigned to the mission of stealing the decoding device are #3, former KGB agent Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), and #5, Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal ), an expert chess player who has plotted every move of the mission. Kronsteen's plan requires using Bond's weakness for women as an element in acquiring the decoding device. Once Bond obtains the decoding device from Russian cipher clerk Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), SPECTRE muscleman Red Grant (Robert Shaw) is to forcibly take it from Bond and kill him.

When an American spacecraft disappears during a mission, it's widely believed to have been intercepted by the Soviet Union, and after a Russian space capsule similarly goes missing, most consider it to be an act of American retaliation. Soon the two nations are at the brink of war, but British intelligence discovers that some sort of UFO has crashed into the Sea of Japan.

      While on assignment in North Korea, Bond is captured by government agents, where he's imprisoned and tortured for over a year.

Starring Barry Nelson as Jimmy Bond, Linda Christian as the Bond girl, Peter Lorre as the villain, Le Chiffre, with Michael Pate as Clarence Leiter. In a nationality twist, "Jimmy Bond" is a CIA agent, and "Clarence Leiter" is Bond's British ally.

      Starring Sean Connery  as James Bond, Kim Basinger as Domino, Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush, and Klaus Maria Brandauer as the villain, Largo. Directed by Irvin Kershner. This film doesn't count on the "official" James Bond film listing, as it was released by Warner Brothers rather than United Artists. Produced by Kevin McClory [not Cubby Broccoli and Eon]. Basically a remake of Thunderball. It was released the same year as the "official" Octopussy.
