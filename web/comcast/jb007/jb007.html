      In From Russia With Love, the bad guys don't want to take over the world. They want something more mundane -- a Russian decoding device. Assigned to the mission of stealing the decoding device are #3, former KGB agent Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), and #5, Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal ), an expert chess player who has plotted every move of the mission. Kronsteen's plan requires using Bond's weakness for women as an element in acquiring the decoding device. Once Bond obtains the decoding device from Russian cipher clerk Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), SPECTRE muscleman Red Grant (Robert Shaw) is to forcibly take it from Bond and kill him.

      Thunderball finds James Bond matching wits with the sinister espionage organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E, (which stands for Special Executive for Counter-Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion). This time, SPECTRE hijacks a NATO nuclear bomber, hiding the bombs under the ocean depths and threatening to detonate the weapons unless a ransom of 100,000,000 pounds is paid. The mastermind behind this scheme is international business executive Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi ), who maintains a pool full of sharks for the purpose of eliminating enemies and those henchmen who fail to come up to standard.

       James Bond heads East to save the world (and to learn how to serve saki properly) in this action-packed espionage adventure. When an American spacecraft disappears during a mission, it's widely believed to have been intercepted by the Soviet Union, and after a Russian space capsule similarly goes missing, most consider it to be an act of American retaliation. Soon the two nations are at the brink of war, but British intelligence discovers that some sort of UFO has crashed into the Sea of Japan.

      Fragments of Ian Fleming's original 1954 novel remain, including the characters of the alluring Tiffany Case (Jill St. John, who wears the equivalent of a postage stamp throughout the film) and fey hit men Wynt and Mr. Kidd. The rest of Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz' script goes its own merry way, involving Bond in a scheme by the insidious Ernst Blofeld (Charles Gray) to force the world powers to disarm so that he can take over the globe.

      Despite a problem with the title ( originally Licence Revoked ) and a higher censorship certificate Timothy Dalton continues in the role of British spy James Bond. The opening has James attending the wedding of his pal and ex-CIA agent Felix Leiter. On the way to the church their car is stopped by Leiter's pals and told of drug lord Franz Sanchez ( Robert Davi ) making a rare trip to Florida to sort out a personal matter. With James in tow, Felix flies off in a DEA helicopter to capture Sanchez - if so important why only 3 of them armed and Bond going after him ? ... perhaps a budget cut ? After much shooting James hooks Sanchez's escaping plane in mid-air followed by James and Felix parachuting down for the waiting bride. Enter Gladys Knight ( without her Pips ) with a powerful Bond song and the titles.

      Agent 007 and his partner Agent 006 (Sean Bean ) pull a daring raid on a chemical weapons plant in the Soviet Union.

Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen ), a beautiful but vicious villain working with the Russian Mafia, spearheads the theft of the controls to GoldenEye, a high-tech satellite weapons system, and with her gunmen, she kills most of the soldiers and guards at a top-secret military facility in the process.
